#+TITLE: Waf Tools

This repository holds some simple waf tools which help build code.  They are nothing fancy.

* Setting up for building

Using these waf tools assume you are building your code with waf.  These tools simply need to be put into a sub directory of your package.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ git clone git@github.com:BNLIF/waf-tools.git tools
#+END_EXAMPLE


* Using the tools

These tools are used in the usual waf-way.  In your =wscript= file you may have:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def configure(ctx):
      ctx.load('find_root', tooldir='tools')
#+END_SRC

You can now use any functionality the tool provides.

* Building

This package provides a copy of =waf=.  If you want to use it, either copy it somewhere in your =$PATH= or alternatively alias is like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ alias waf=/path/to/these/tools/waf
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Examples

t.b.d.
